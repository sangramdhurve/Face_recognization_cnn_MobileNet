# Face_recognization_cnn_MobileNet
We have used here MobileNet



``` It is a real time face recognization model, I am a intern in Juntran technoloy Bangalore, in this model we have used transfer learning technique, we tried with defferent models like VGG16, VGG19, AlexNet, ResNet50, GoogleNet version1,2,3 and MobileNet. with defferent parameters. it is giving 100% accuracy.```

dataset =>


train = [size(224*224*3), classes=8, count=1144/per class]


test = [size(224*224*3), classes=8, count=60/per class]
